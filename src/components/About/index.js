I am a full stack developer with a background in the health field wanting to merge my experience and ideas with web based applications/software in order to give users a wonderful experience. I recently earned a certificate in full stack development from Southern Methodist University. I have developed skills that include JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React, MongoDb, Mysql, Algorithms, Data Structures, API development, and JQuery. I am known for my creativity, self-motivation, working well with others, passion for completing projects, and bringing a visually intuitive application to the user. I have recently worked on a team that developed an application for helping doctors schedule house call appointments. I am excited to put my skills to good use so that I can develop first className applications and software.
